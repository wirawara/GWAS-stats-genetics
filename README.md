# Resources for GWAS (statistical genetics)

This repository contains resources needed for analyzing [GWAS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/gwas-catalogue-exploring-snp-trait-associations/what-is-gwas-catalog/what-are-genome-wide-association-studies-gwas/) data.


The content of this repository:

* Online learning material
* Interesting articles
* Publicly available genetic data (raw or summarized)
* Tools to perform statistical analyses on genetic data



### Online learning material

* Access course material [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1srSMRG-M-7_23ZaXVJ-oLmm_T1sSSGxP/view) by [Abdel Abdellaoui](https://twitter.com/dr_appie).

* [**Lectures** at the Broad Institute](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlMMtlgw6qNjROoMNTBQjAcdx53kV50cS), for example the one by [Hilary Finucane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mivyklWDtBI).

* The Broad Institute has some [recordings](https://sites.google.com/broadinstitute.com/onlinejournalclub/other-genetic-presentations?authuser=0) from the **"Medical Population Genetics Program"**

* [This](https://sites.google.com/broadinstitute.com/onlinejournalclub) online **journalclub** from the Broad Institute is not active anymore, but has some nice recordings.
